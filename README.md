# Rapeseed_Dataset
This is a rapeseed inflorescence dataset. It can be used for target detection and recognition network model. RIB Folder that includes 165 plot images with 60000 manual labels is mainly used to train model and test the accuracy of the model. 
Sparse, medium-density and dense datasets are used to test which density of rape inflorescence the model was suitable for. 
The data in Test_Set_A and Test_Set_B is from different fields and years. Each dataset includes 30 plot images with manual labels. Test_Set_A and Test_Set_B are used to test accuracy of the model in counting rapeseed inflorescences.
